    I am currently researching on analyzing usersâ€™ eye movements within Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality. I researched 
    on identifying objective measures using eye movements to effectively assess the engagement
    of fake news. I  worked on a project that analyzes the reading patterns of researchers using eye tracking.
    I collaborated with Pennsylvania State University on researching and developing methods to automatically extract
    features from papers for predicting reproducibility of scientific papers. I also worked on encoding
    Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) using word embedding and building a heuristic classifier
    that will predict if a given page of ETD is a title page or not. I volunteered as a graduate student assistant for the <a href="https://oducsreu.github.io">
    ODU Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)</a> in Disinformation Detection and Analytics Summer 2022 program.
